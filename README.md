# Spider Suite Project

### The point of this project is to trim time off of your next scrapy project

### spider_suite has:

* a script to run the spiders from called 'main.py' 

* a custom pipeline for each spider

### The actual scrapers don't do much as of August 17, 2016 but the point
### of the project is to cut time on infrastructure development
